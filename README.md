# Movie-Rating-Prediction
Ensured data integrity by dropping rows with missing values and converting 'Year' and 'Duration' columns to 
numeric types.

Extracted, split, and analyzed individual genres; visualized frequency using word clouds and bar plots.

Created line and box plots to illustrate annual movie release patterns, movie duration trends, and distribution 
of release years and durations.

Analyzed the relationship between movie ratings and number of votes; visualized results with a line plot.

Split data into training/testing sets; trained and evaluated multiple regression models (Linear Regression, 
Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM, CatBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors) 
to predict movie ratings.
